This is a repository that contains web pages hosted on github.

See: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

In order to update the pages, just push the modifications to the branch 
main (to change it, go to https://github.com/ioChiedo/webpages/settings)

Basically each page is served from a different directory, which contains 
an index.html file.

This is the root url:

https://iochiedo.github.io/webpages/

NOTE: it returns 404 because there's no index.html, index.md, or README.md 
file in there (this is intentional, but can be changed, e.g. you might 
want to show a list of all pages available. 

NOTE: GitHub Pages will look for an index.html, index.md, or README.md 
file as the entry file for your site and in any subfolders (this is how we 
can interpret the creation of filenames with / in the name).
